## About
One of the most useful data structures in computer science is the hash table. Many hash table implementations exist with varying properties, but in general they offer fast lookups, adds, and deletes. Go provides a built-in 'map' type that implements a hash table. Following is an implementation of maps where in keys are people's name and values are their respective ages.

## Compiler and Documentation
The compiler and documentation for golang can be found <a href="https://golang.org/">here</a>
